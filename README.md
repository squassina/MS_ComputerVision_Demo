Some implementations of the code for MS Computer Vision as per the docs.

The sample here is using the following APIs:

The only requirement for one to start testing the API is to have a Computer Vision / Cognitive services subscription and export the `'OCP_APIM_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY'` all immages are available in the internet and you can adjust to open your own images from there.

The same images are used in the local demo, but you will need to download it from the internet.
